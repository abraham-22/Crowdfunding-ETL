# Crowdfunding-ETL

### Purpose:
The purpose of this Data Analysis is to help an Independent crowdfunding platform  to move all their accessible data from one Excel file onto a PostgreSQL database. This process includes collecting, cleaning, and storing data in a database prior to performing analysis. We used Python and Pandas to perform the first two process- the extract and transform steps. Then, we created a PostgreSQL database and table schemas by using an entity relationship diagram (ERD), and load the data into the database. And finally, we used SQL to perform data analysis.

### Resources:
Software: Python and Pandas, PostgreSQL, DBD to create ERD
